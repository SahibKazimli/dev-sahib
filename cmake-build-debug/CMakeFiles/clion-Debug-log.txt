CMake Error at /Users/sahibkazimli/Applications/CLion.app/Contents/bin/cmake/mac/aarch64/share/cmake-3.30/Modules/CMakeFindDependencyMacro.cmake:76 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findhiredis.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "hiredis", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "hiredis" with any
  of the following names:

    hiredisConfig.cmake
    hiredis-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "hiredis" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "hiredis_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "hiredis" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
